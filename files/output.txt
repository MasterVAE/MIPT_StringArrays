[256]          A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
[257]          All flaxen was his poll.
[258]          And hath shipped me intil the land,
[259]          And in his grave rain'd many a tear.
[260]          And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
[261]          And will he not come again?
[262]          And will he not come again?
[263]          Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
[264]          Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
[265]          But age with his stealing steps
[266]          By his cockle bat and' staff
[267]          For if the King like not the comedy,
[268]          For some must watch, while some must sleep:
[269]          For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
[270]          God 'a'mercy on his soul!
[271]          Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd  
[272]          He never will come again.
[273]          His beard was as white as snow,
[274]          How should I your true-love know
[275]          Methought it was very sweet;
[276]          Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd
[277]          O, a Pit of clay for to be made  
[278]          O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.
[279]          Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
[280]          Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
[281]          That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
[282]          They bore him barefac'd on the bier
[283]          To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
[284]          When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
[285]          Which bewept to the grave did not go
[286]          Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
[287]          With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
[288]          With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
[289]          With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
[290]         Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern [with Attendants].
[291]        Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, [Guildenstern,] and others.
[292]        In youth when I did love, did love,
[293]        To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
[294]       'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
[295]       'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to

[297]       (Unless things mortal move them not at all)
[298]       A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-  
[299]       A second time I kill my husband dead
[300]       A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
[301]       About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
[302]       About the world have times twelve thirties been,
[303]       An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
[304]       And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
[305]       And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
[306]       And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
[307]       And never come mischance between us twain!
[308]       And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
[309]       And passion in the gods.'
[310]       And thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen
[311]       And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
[312]       And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
[313]       And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
[314]       Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
[315]       Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
[316]       As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
[317]       As low as to the fiends!
[318]       Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
[319]       Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
[320]       But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
[321]       But fill unshaken when they mellow be.
[322]       But if the gods themselves did see her then,
[323]       But what we do determine oft we break.
[324]       But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword  
[325]       But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
[326]       But, as we often see, against some storm,
[327]       But, orderly to end where I begun,  
[328]       Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
[329]       Did nothing.
[330]       Directly seasons him his enemy.
[331]       Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
[332]       Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
[333]       Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
[334]       For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
[335]       For husband shalt thou-
[336]       For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
[337]       For women's fear and love holds quantity,
[338]       Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
[339]       Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
[340]       Here stooping to your clemency,
[341]       Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
[342]       If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
[343]       In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
[344]       In general synod take away her power;
[345]       In neither aught, or in extremity.
[346]       Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
[347]       Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
[348]       Most necessary 'tis that we forget
[349]       My operant powers their functions leave to do.
[350]       My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
[351]       Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
[352]       None wed the second but who killed the first.
[353]       Now falls on Priam.
[354]       Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
[355]       Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick.
[356]       Of violent birth, but poor validity;
[357]       On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
[358]       On wholesome life usurp immediately.
[359]       Ophelia,'-
[360]       Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
[361]       Our wills and fates do so contrary run
[362]       Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,  
[363]       Purpose is but the slave to memory,
[364]       Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
[365]       Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
[366]       Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
[367]       Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
[368]       Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
[369]       So far from cheer and from your former state.
[370]       So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
[371]       So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
[372]       Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
[373]       Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
[374]       Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
[375]       Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
[376]       Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
[377]       Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
[378]       That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
[379]       That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
[380]       That our devices still are overthrown;
[381]       The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
[382]       The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
[383]       The instant burst of clamour that she made
[384]       The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
[385]       The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
[386]       The tedious day with sleep.
[387]       The violence of either grief or joy
[388]       Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
[389]       This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
[390]       Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
[391]       Thy natural magic and dire property
[392]       To desperation turn my trust and hope,
[393]       To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
[394]       Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
[395]       We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]
[396]       What to ourselves in passion we propose,
[397]       When second husband kisses me in bed.
[398]       When second husband let me be accurst!
[399]       When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
[400]       Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
[401]       Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
[402]       Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
[403]       Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
[404]       Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
[405]       Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,  
[406]       Which was declining on the milky head
[407]       Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
[408]       With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
[409]       With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
[410]       With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
[411]       Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
[412]       be otherwise.
[413]       phrase.
[414]      discretion.
[415]     'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-
[416]     'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
[417]     'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
[418]     'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
[419]     'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.

[455]     A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
[456]     A combination and a form indeed
[457]     A couch for luxury and damned incest.
[458]     A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
[459]     A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
[460]     A double blessing is a double grace;
[461]     A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
[462]     A face without a heart,'
[463]     A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
[464]     A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
[465]     A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
[466]     A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
[467]     A little month, or ere those shoes were old
[468]     A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
[469]     A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
[470]     A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
[471]     A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
[472]     A sable silver'd.
[473]     A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
[474]     A scullion!  
[475]     A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
[476]     A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
[477]     A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
[478]     A station like the herald Mercury
[479]     A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
[480]     A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
[481]     A very noble youth. Mark.
[482]     A villain kills my father; and for that,

[484]     A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
[485]     Absent thee from felicity awhile,
[486]     Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
[487]     According to the phrase or the addition

[489]     Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
[490]     Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.

[493]     After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
[494]     After the thing it loves.
[495]     Against the which a moiety competent
[496]     Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
[497]     Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
[498]     Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!
[499]     Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
[500]     Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is
[501]     All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
[502]     All given to mine ear.
[503]     All may be well.                                  He kneels.
[504]     All my smooth body.
[505]     All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
[506]     Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
[507]     Among a mineral of metals base,
[508]     An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
[509]     An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
[510]     An understanding simple and unschool'd;
[511]     And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
[512]     And I am sick at heart.
[513]     And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
[514]     And I beseech you instantly to visit
[515]     And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
[516]     And I do think- or else this brain of mine
[517]     And I the matter will reword; which madness
[518]     And I with them the third night kept the watch;
[519]     And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
[520]     And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
[521]     And You must put me in your heart for friend,
[522]     And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
[523]     And a most instant tetter bark'd about,  
[524]     And after we will both our judgments join
[525]     And all we mourn for.  
[526]     And am most sensibly in grief for it,
[527]     And at our more consider'd time we'll read,  
[528]     And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
[529]     And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
[530]     And bear it to the chapel.
[531]     And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
[532]     And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
[533]     And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
[534]     And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
[535]     And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
[536]     And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
[537]     And break your own neck down.
[538]     And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
[539]     And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
[540]     And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
[541]     And call it accident.
[542]     And call the noblest to the audience.
[543]     And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
[544]     And carriage of the article design'd,
[545]     And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
[546]     And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
[547]     And could of men distinguish, her election
[548]     And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
[549]     And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
[550]     And do not spread the compost on the weeds
[551]     And do such bitter business as the day
[552]     And do't the speedier that you may direct me
[553]     And draw you into madness? Think of it.
[554]     And drive his purpose on to these delights.
[555]     And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed  
[556]     And each particular hair to stand an end
[557]     And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
[558]     And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
[559]     And enterprises of great pith and moment
[560]     And even the like precurse of fierce events,
[561]     And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
[562]     And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
[563]     And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
[564]     And for his death no wind
[565]     And for my means, I'll husband them so well
[566]     And for my soul, what can it do to that,
[567]     And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
[568]     And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
[569]     And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
[570]     And for your rapier most especially,
[571]     And foreign mart for implements of war;
[572]     And from her fair and unpolluted flesh  
[573]     And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
[574]     And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
[575]     And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
[576]     And gave you such a masterly report
[577]     And gem of all the nation.
[578]     And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
[579]     And hath abatements and delays as many  
[580]     And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
[581]     And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
[582]     And he to England shall along with you.
[583]     And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
[584]     And hears it roar beneath.
[585]     And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
[586]     And his commission to employ those soldiers,
[587]     And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
[588]     And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
[589]     And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
[590]     And hurt my brother.
[591]     And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
[592]     And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
[593]     And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
[594]     And in the cup an union shall he throw
[595]     And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
[596]     And in the porches of my ears did pour
[597]     And in this brainish apprehension kills
[598]     And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
[599]     And it must follow, as the night the day,
[600]     And keep you in the rear of your affection,  
[601]     And lay your hands again upon my sword.
[602]     And leads the will to desperate undertakings
[603]     And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
[604]     And let him know so.
[605]     And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
[606]     And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
[607]     And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
[608]     And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
[609]     And let them know both what we mean to do
[610]     And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
[611]     And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
[612]     And let us once again assail your ears,
[613]     And live the purer with the other half,
[614]     And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
[615]     And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
[616]     And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
[617]     And makes each petty artire in this body
[618]     And makes us rather bear those ills we have
[619]     And many such-like as's of great charge,
[620]     And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
[621]     And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
[622]     And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame  
[623]     And more above, hath his solicitings,
[624]     And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
[625]     And my imaginations are as foul
[626]     And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
[627]     And not have strew'd thy grave.
[628]     And not where I had aim'd them.
[629]     And nothing is at a like goodness still;
[630]     And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
[631]     And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
[632]     And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
[633]     And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi', you.
[634]     And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
[635]     And our affairs from England come too late.  
[636]     And our vain blows malicious mockery.
[637]     And pious action we do sugar o'er  
[638]     And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
[639]     And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
[640]     And prey on garbage.
[641]     And prologue to the omen coming on,
[642]     And put it in his pocket!  
[643]     And reason panders will.
[644]     And recks not his own rede.
[645]     And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
[646]     And set a double varnish on the fame
[647]     And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
[648]     And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
[649]     And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
[650]     And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
[651]     And so, without more circumstance at all,
[652]     And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
[653]     And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
[654]     And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
[655]     And sure I am two men there are not living
[656]     And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
[657]     And tell you what I know.
[658]     And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
[659]     And that I see, in passages of proof,
[660]     And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
[661]     And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
[662]     And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
[663]     And that in way of caution- I must tell you
[664]     And that our drift look through our bad performance.
[665]     And that shall lend a kind of easiness
[666]     And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
[667]     And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-  
[668]     And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
[669]     And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
[670]     And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
[671]     And there I see such black and grained spots
[672]     And there assume some other, horrible form
[673]     And there did seem in him a kind of joy
[674]     And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
[675]     And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
[676]     And these few precepts in thy memory
[677]     And they can well on horseback; but this gallant  
[678]     And they in France of the best rank and station
[679]     And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
[680]     And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
[681]     And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
[682]     And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
[683]     And thus a while the fit will work on him.
[684]     And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
[685]     And thus the native hue of resolution
[686]     And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
[687]     And thy commandment all alone shall live
[688]     And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
[689]     And to the last bended their light on me.
[690]     And to the manner born, it is a custom
[691]     And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
[692]     And vanish'd from our sight.
[693]     And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
[694]     And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
[695]     And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
[696]     And we beseech you, bend you to remain
[697]     And we did think it writ down in our duty
[698]     And we shall jointly labour with your soul
[699]     And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
[700]     And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
[701]     And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
[702]     And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
[703]     And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
[704]     And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
[705]     And when you are desirous to be blest,
[706]     And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
[707]     And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
[708]     And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
[709]     And will not let belief take hold of him
[710]     And will not wrong it.
[711]     And will this brother's wager frankly play.
[712]     And with a larger tether may he walk
[713]     And with a look so piteous in purport
[714]     And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
[715]     And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
[716]     And with no less nobility of love
[717]     And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
[718]     And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
[719]     And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
[720]     And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
[721]     And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
[722]     And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
[723]     And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
[724]     And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
[725]     And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
[726]     And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
[727]     And, as I think, they have already order
[728]     And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
[729]     And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
[730]     And, as the world were now but to begin,
[731]     And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
[732]     And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
[733]     And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
[734]     And, like a man to double business bound,
[735]     And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
[736]     And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
[737]     And, sister, as the winds give benefit
[738]     And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
[739]     Anon, as patient as the female dove
[740]     Answer, and think upon this business.
[741]     Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
[742]     Appears before them and with solemn march
[743]     Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid  
[744]     Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
[745]     Are joyfully return'd.
[746]     Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
[747]     Are most select and generous, chief in that.
[748]     Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
[749]     Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.  
[750]     As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
[751]     As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
[752]     As England was his faithful tributary,
[753]     As I do thee. Something too much of this I
[754]     As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
[755]     As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
[756]     As are companions noted and most known
[757]     As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
[758]     As checking at his voyage, and that he means
[759]     As day does to your eye.
[760]     As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
[761]     As did that one; and that, in my regard,
[762]     As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
[763]     As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
[764]     As fits a king's remembrance.
[765]     As from the body of contraction plucks  
[766]     As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
[767]     As harbingers preceding still the fates
[768]     As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
[769]     As he in his particular act and place
[770]     As he is very potent with such spirits,
[771]     As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
[772]     As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
[773]     As if he had been loosed out of hell
[774]     As if increase of appetite had grown
[775]     As if it some impartment did desire
[776]     As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
[777]     As infinite as man may undergo-  
[778]     As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
[779]     As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
[780]     As it doth well appear unto our state,
[781]     As it hath us'd to do- that I have found  
[782]     As it is common for the younger sort
[783]     As kill a king, and marry with his brother.  
[784]     As level as the cannon to his blank,
[785]     As love between them like the palm might flourish,
[786]     As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
[787]     As make your bouts more violent to that end-
[788]     As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
[789]     As meditation or the thoughts of love,
[790]     As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
[791]     As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
[792]     As of a father; for let the world take note
[793]     As oft as any passion under heaven
[794]     As one incapable of her own distress,
[795]     As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
[796]     As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
[797]     As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
[798]     As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
[799]     As therein are set down.
[800]     As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
[801]     As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
[802]     As to expend your time with us awhile
[803]     As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
[804]     As to peace-parted souls.
[805]     As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
[806]     As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
[807]     As will not leave their tinct.
[808]     As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
[809]     Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
[810]     At gaming, swearing, or about some act
[811]     At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
[812]     At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        [Writes.]
[813]     At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
[814]     Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
[815]     Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
[816]     Away! for everything is seal'd and done
[817]     Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
[818]     Be all my sins rememb'red.
[819]     Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
[820]     Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
[821]     Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
[822]     Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
[823]     Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
[824]     Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
[825]     Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
[826]     Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
[827]     Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
[828]     Be you and I behind an arras then.
[829]     Be you content to lend your patience to us,
[830]     Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
[831]     Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
[832]     Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
[833]     Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
[834]     Been struck so to the soul that presently
[835]     Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
[836]     Before You visit him, to make inquire
[837]     Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
[838]     Before my daughter told me), what might you,
[839]     Behind the arras I'll convey myself
[840]     Behind the arras hearing something stir,
[841]     Being a thing immortal as itself?  
[842]     Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
[843]     Believe so much in him, that he is young,
[844]     Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
[845]     Between the pass and fell incensed points
[846]     Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
[847]     Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?  
[848]     Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
[849]     Both to my God and to my gracious king;
[850]     Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
[851]     Break we our watch up; and by my advice  
[852]     Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
[853]     Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
[854]     Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
[855]     Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
[856]     But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
[857]     But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
[858]     But I do prophesy th' election lights  
[859]     But I have that within which passeth show-
[860]     But I will delve one yard below their mines
[861]     But answer made it none. Yet once methought
[862]     But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
[863]     But better look'd into, he truly found
[864]     But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
[865]     But come!
[866]     But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
[867]     But do not go with it!
[868]     But even his mother shall uncharge the practice  
[869]     But even then the morning cock crew loud,
[870]     But farewell it, for I will use no art.  
[871]     But from what cause he will by no means speak.
[872]     But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
[873]     But he's an arrant knave.
[874]     But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
[875]     But if you hold it fit, after the play
[876]     But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
[877]     But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
[878]     But in battalions! First, her father slain;
[879]     But in our circumstance and course of thought,
[880]     But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
[881]     But keep a farm and carters.
[882]     But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
[883]     But let me hear from you.
[884]     But let that go.
[885]     But let this same be presently perform'd,
[886]     But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
[887]     But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
[888]     But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
[889]     But mere implorators of unholy suits,  
[890]     But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
[891]     But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
[892]     But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
[893]     But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
[894]     But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
[895]     But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
[896]     But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
[897]     But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
[898]     But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
[899]     But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-
[900]     But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
[901]     But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
[902]     But that I know love is begun by time,
[903]     But that the dread of something after death-
[904]     But that this folly douts it.                          Exit.
[905]     But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
[906]     But this eternal blazon must not be
[907]     But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
[908]     But to confront the visage of offence?
[909]     But to my mind, though I am native here  
[910]     But to recover of us, by strong hand
[911]     But truly I do fear it.
[912]     But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
[913]     But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
[914]     But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
[915]     But what is your affair in Elsinore?
[916]     But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
[917]     But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
[918]     But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
[919]     But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
[920]     But you must know, your father lost a father;
[921]     But you shall hear. Thus:
[922]     But you'll be secret?
[923]     But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
[924]     But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
[925]     But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great
[926]     But, like the owner of a foul disease,
[927]     But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
[928]     Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above.
[929]     By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
[930]     By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!-
[931]     By heaven, it is as proper to our age
[932]     By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight
[933]     By indirections find directions out.
[934]     By laboursome petition, and at last
[935]     By letters congruing to that effect,
[936]     By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
[937]     By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
[938]     By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
[939]     By this encompassment and drift of question
[940]     By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
[941]     Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
[942]     Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murther'?
[943]     Can you advise me?
[944]     Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
[945]     Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
[946]     Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
[947]     Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
[948]     Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,  
[949]     Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
[950]     Collected from all simples that have virtue
[951]     Come hither, gentlemen,
[952]     Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
[953]     Come short of what he did.
[954]     Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends
[955]     Come, I will give you way for these your letters,
[956]     Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
[957]     Come, some music!
[958]     Come.
[959]     Come. (They play.) Another hit. What say you?
[960]     Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
[961]     Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
[962]     Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
[963]     Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
[964]     Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
[965]     Consent to swear.
[966]     Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
[967]     Contagious blastments are most imminent.
[968]     Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
[969]     Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,  
[970]     Couch we awhile, and mark.
[971]     Could force his soul so to his own conceit
[972]     Could not (with all their quantity of love)
[973]     Could not so mope.
[974]     Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
[975]     Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
[976]     Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
[977]     Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
[978]     Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
[979]     Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
[980]     Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
[981]     Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
[982]     Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
[983]     Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
[984]     Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your
[985]     Depriv'd thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
[986]     Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.
[987]     Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
[988]     Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
[989]     Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
[990]     Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
[991]     Did not together pluck such envy from him
[992]     Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
[993]     Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!
[994]     Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;  
[995]     Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
[996]     Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
[997]     Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw  
[998]     Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
[999]     Divided from herself and her fair-judgment,
[1000]     Do I impart toward you. For your intent  
[1001]     Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
[1002]     Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
[1003]     Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
[1004]     Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
[1005]     Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
[1006]     Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
[1007]     Does by their own insinuation grow.
[1008]     Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
[1009]     Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
[1010]     Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of
[1011]     Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.
[1012]     Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
[1013]     Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
[1014]     Drabbing. You may go so far.
[1015]     Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?
[1016]     Each small annexment, petty consequence,
[1017]     Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
[1018]     Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
[1019]     Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
[1020]     Else could you not have motion; but sure that sense
[1021]     Elsinore.
[1022]     Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
[1023]     Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
[1024]     Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
[1025]     Enter [priests with] a coffin [in funeral procession], King,
[1026]     Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
[1027]     Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
[1028]     Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
[1029]     Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
[1030]     Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
[1031]     Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
[1032]     Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
[1033]     Even while men's minds are wild, lest more mischance
[1034]     Even with the very comment of thy soul
[1035]     Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
[1036]     Excitements of my reason and my blood,
[1037]     Exposing what is mortal and unsure
[1038]     Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
[1039]     Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
[1040]     Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
[1041]     Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
[1042]     Fare you well, my dove!
[1043]     Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
[1044]     Farewell, dear mother.
[1045]     Farewell. My blessing season this in thee!
[1046]     Farewell.
[1047]     Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
[1048]     Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
[1049]     Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
[1050]     Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
[1051]     Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
[1052]     Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard
[1053]     Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
[1054]     Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
[1055]     Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
[1056]     Follow my mother.                                 King dies.
[1057]     For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
[1058]     For England.
[1059]     For Hecuba!
[1060]     For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
[1061]     For art and exercise in your defence,
[1062]     For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,  
[1063]     For by the image of my cause I see
[1064]     For every man hath business and desire,
[1065]     For food and diet, to some enterprise
[1066]     For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
[1067]     For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
[1068]     For he himself is subject to his birth.
[1069]     For he was likely, had he been put on,
[1070]     For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
[1071]     For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
[1072]     For in the fatness of these pursy times
[1073]     For it is as the air, invulnerable,
[1074]     For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
[1075]     For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
[1076]     For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died
[1077]     For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
[1078]     For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak
[1079]     For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
[1080]     For nature crescent does not grow alone
[1081]     For out o' doors he went without their help
[1082]     For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
[1083]     For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
[1084]     For the demand of our neglected tribute.
[1085]     For the supply and profit of our hope,
[1086]     For they are actions that a man might play;
[1087]     For this effect defective comes by cause.
[1088]     For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
[1089]     For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
[1090]     For we will fetters put upon this fear,
[1091]     For what advancement may I hope from thee,  
[1092]     For what we know must be, and is as common
[1093]     For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
[1094]     For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
[1095]     For your desire to know what is between us,
[1096]     For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
[1097]     Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
[1098]     Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
[1099]     Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
[1100]     Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
[1101]     Free me so far in your most generous thoughts  
[1102]     Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
[1103]     From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
[1104]     From me, whose love was of that dignity
[1105]     From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
[1106]     From that particular fault. The dram of e'il
[1107]     From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
[1108]     From the first corse till he that died to-day,
[1109]     From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
[1110]     Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
[1111]     Get you a place.
[1112]     Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
[1113]     Give him the cup.
[1114]     Give it an understanding but no tongue.
[1115]     Give me my father!
[1116]     Give me one poor request.
[1117]     Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
[1118]     Give us the foils. Come on.
[1119]     Give you good night.                                   Exit.
[1120]     Give, me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
[1121]     Given private time to you, and you yourself
[1122]     Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
[1123]     Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
[1124]     Giving to you no further personal power
[1125]     Go on. I'll follow thee.
[1126]     Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
[1127]     Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
[1128]     Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together.
[1129]     Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
[1130]     God bless you, sir!
[1131]     God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
[1132]     Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
[1133]     Gonzago'?
[1134]     Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
[1135]     Good gentlemen, give him a further edge
[1136]     Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you
[1137]     Good night, mother.
[1138]     Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
[1139]     Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
[1140]     Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
[1141]     Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
[1142]     Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,  
[1143]     Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
[1144]     Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
[1145]     Had he the motive and the cue for passion
[1146]     Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
[1147]     Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
[1148]     Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
[1149]     Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
[1150]     Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
[1151]     Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
[1152]     Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
[1153]     Hamlet the Dane.                    [Leaps in after Laertes.
[1154]     Haply the seas, and countries different,
[1155]     Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and blest are those
[1156]     Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.
[1157]     Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
[1158]     Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
[1159]     Hath scald thee for herself. For thou hast been
[1160]     Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
[1161]     Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre
[1162]     Have by the very cunning of the scene
[1163]     Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
[1164]     Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
[1165]     Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
[1166]     Have you so slander any moment leisure
[1167]     Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
[1168]     Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
[1169]     He answers:
[1170]     He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman.
[1171]     He closes with you in this consequence:
[1172]     He falls to such perusal of my face
[1173]     He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
[1174]     He likewise gives a frock or livery,
[1175]     He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
[1176]     He may not, as unvalued persons do,
[1177]     He never gave commandment for their death.
[1178]     He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
[1179]     He seem'd to find his way without his eyes,
[1180]     He should the bearers put to sudden death,
[1181]     He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
[1182]     He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
[1183]     He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
[1184]     He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
[1185]     He took my father grossly, full of bread,
[1186]     He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to
[1187]     He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
[1188]     Hecuba.
[1189]     Help, help, ho!
[1190]     Her brother is in secret come from France;
[1191]     Her father and myself (lawful espials)
[1192]     Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
[1193]     Her mood will needs be pitied.
[1194]     Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
[1195]     Here in the lobby.
[1196]     Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
[1197]     Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
[1198]     Here's to thy health.
[1199]     Here's yet some liquor left.
[1200]     Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.  
[1201]     Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
[1202]     High on a stage be placed to the view;
[1203]     Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
[1204]     His access to me.
[1205]     His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
[1206]     His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
[1207]     His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
[1208]     His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
[1209]     His further gait herein, in that the levies,
[1210]     His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
[1211]     His liberty is full of threats to all-
[1212]     His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
[1213]     His means of death, his obscure funeral-
[1214]     His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
[1215]     His silence will sit drooping.
[1216]     Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
[1217]     Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
[1218]     Hold you the watch to-night?
[1219]     Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
[1220]     Holds such an enmity with blood of man
[1221]     Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
[1222]     Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He
[1223]     How all occasions do inform against me
[1224]     How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
[1225]     How does my good Lord Hamlet?
[1226]     How does your honour for this many a day?
[1227]     How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one, that
[1228]     How in my words somever she be shent,
[1229]     How much I had to do to calm his rage I
[1230]     How now O What hath befall'n?
[1231]     How now, Ophelia? What's the matter?
[1232]     How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
[1233]     How now, sweet queen?
[1234]     How now? What news?
[1235]     How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
[1236]     How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself
[1237]     How these things came about. So shall You hear
[1238]     How to forget that learning; but, sir, now  
[1239]     How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
[1240]     Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.             Exit.
[1241]     Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
[1242]     Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
[1243]     Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
[1244]     I am afeard You make a wanton of me.
[1245]     I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
[1246]     I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
[1247]     I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
[1248]     I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
[1249]     I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
[1250]     I be so able as now.
[1251]     I bought an unction of a mountebank,
[1252]     I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.  
[1253]     I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
[1254]     I cannot live to hear the news from England,
[1255]     I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
[1256]     I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
[1257]     I could not but by her. The other motive
[1258]     I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
[1259]     I did repel his letters and denied
[1260]     I do beseech you give him leave to go.
[1261]     I do not know from what part of the world
[1262]     I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
[1263]     I do receive your offer'd love like love,
[1264]     I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
[1265]     I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
[1266]     I ha't!
[1267]     I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
[1268]     I had my father's signet in my purse,
[1269]     I had not quoted him. I fear'd he did but trifle
[1270]     I have a daughter (have while she is mine),
[1271]     I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
[1272]     I have a voice and precedent of peace
[1273]     I have in quick determination
[1274]     I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
[1275]     I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
[1276]     I have sworn't.
[1277]     I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe  
[1278]     I hold it fit that we shake hands and part;
[1279]     I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
[1280]     I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
[1281]     I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
[1282]     I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
[1283]     I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
[1284]     I made to her in marriage, and to decline
[1285]     I must be cruel, only to be kind;
[1286]     I never gave you aught.
[1287]     I once did hold it, as our statists do,
[1288]     I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
[1289]     I pray you go with me.
[1290]     I pray you, now receive them.
[1291]     I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
[1292]     I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
[1293]     I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
[1294]     I say, away!- Go on. I'll follow thee.
[1295]     I shall not look upon his like again.
[1296]     I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
[1297]     I should have fatted all the region kites
[1298]     I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
[1299]     I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
[1300]     I stay too long. But here my father comes.
[1301]     I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
[1302]     I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
[1303]     I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
[1304]     I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
[1305]     I will bestow him, and will answer well
[1306]     I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
[1307]     I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
[1308]     I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my
[1309]     I would know that.
[1310]     I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
[1311]     I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
[1312]     I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,  
[1313]     I'll board him presently. O, give me leave.
[1314]     I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
[1315]     I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
[1316]     I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
[1317]     I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
[1318]     I'll rant as well as thou.
[1319]     I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
[1320]     I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,
[1321]     I'll visit you.
[1322]     I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
[1323]     I, his sole son, do this same villain send
[1324]     If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
[1325]     If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
[1326]     If I had play'd the desk or table book,
[1327]     If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
[1328]     If by direct or by collateral hand
[1329]     If circumstances lead me, I will find
[1330]     If damned custom have not braz'd it so
[1331]     If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
[1332]     If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
[1333]     If his chief good and market of his time
[1334]     If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided
[1335]     If it be made of penetrable stuff;
[1336]     If it be so- as so 'tis put on me,
[1337]     If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do
[1338]     If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
[1339]     If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
[1340]     If there be any good thing to be done,
[1341]     If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
[1342]     If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
[1343]     If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
[1344]     If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
[1345]     If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
[1346]     If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
[1347]     If with too credent ear you list his songs,
[1348]     If you desire to know the certainty
[1349]     If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
[1350]     If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
[1351]     If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his  
[1352]     If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
[1353]     Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
[1354]     Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
[1355]     Importing health and graveness. Two months since
[1356]     Importing the surrender of those lands
[1357]     In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
[1358]     In censure of his seeming.
[1359]     In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
[1360]     In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
[1361]     In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
[1362]     In filial obligation for some term
[1363]     In further evil?
[1364]     In going back to school in Wittenberg,
[1365]     In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
[1366]     In honourable fashion.
[1367]     In hugger-mugger to inter him; Poor Ophelia
[1368]     In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
[1369]     In noise so rude against me?
[1370]     In obstinate condolement is a course
[1371]     In the corrupted currents of this world
[1372]     In the dead vast and middle of the night
[1373]     In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
[1374]     In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
[1375]     In thee there is not half an hour of life.
[1376]     In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
[1377]     In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
[1378]     In which the majesty of buried Denmark
[1379]     Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
[1380]     Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
[1381]     Into a tow'ring passion.
[1382]     Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
[1383]     Into the madness wherein now he raves,
[1384]     Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
[1385]     Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
[1386]     Is by a forged process of my death
[1387]     Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
[1388]     Is it not monstrous that this player here,
[1389]     Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
[1390]     Is not this something more than fantasy?
[1391]     Is not to stir without great argument,
[1392]     Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
[1393]     Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
[1394]     Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
[1395]     Is the great love the general gender bear him,
[1396]     Is the main motive of our preparations,
[1397]     Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
[1398]     Is thought-sick at the act.
[1399]     Is very cunning in.
[1400]     It could not move thus.  
[1401]     It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
[1402]     It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
[1403]     It had been so with us, had we been there.
[1404]     It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
[1405]     It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'  
[1406]     It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
[1407]     It is a poison temper'd by himself.
[1408]     It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
[1409]     It is most retrograde to our desire;
[1410]     It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
[1411]     It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
[1412]     It lifted up it head and did address
[1413]     It may be death.
[1414]     It sends some precious instance of itself
[1415]     It shall as level to your judgment pierce
[1416]     It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
[1417]     It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
[1418]     It warms the very sickness in my heart
[1419]     It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd,
[1420]     It waves me forth again. I'll follow it.
[1421]     It waves you to a more removed ground.
[1422]     It will be laid to us, whose providence
[1423]     It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
[1424]     Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
[1425]     Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,
[1426]     King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me?
[1427]     King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
[1428]     King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;  
[1429]     King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
[1430]     King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
[1431]     Laertes before you fall to play.  
[1432]     Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
[1433]     Last, and as such containing as all these,
[1434]     Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
[1435]     Leave us.
[1436]     Leave wringing of your hinds. Peace! sit you down
[1437]     Led by a delicate and tender prince,
[1438]     Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
[1439]     Lest with this piteous action you convert
[1440]     Let Hercules himself do what he may,
[1441]     Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
[1442]     Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
[1443]     Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.  
[1444]     Let his queen mother all alone entreat him  
[1445]     Let it be tenable in your silence still;
[1446]     Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
[1447]     Let me be no assistant for a state,  
[1448]     Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
[1449]     Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
[1450]     Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
[1451]     Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
[1452]     Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
[1453]     Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
[1454]     Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
[1455]     Let us impart what we have seen to-night
[1456]     Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
[1457]     Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,  
[1458]     Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
[1459]     Like a good child and a true gentleman.
[1460]     Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
[1461]     Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
[1462]     Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places  
[1463]     Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
[1464]     Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
[1465]     Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
[1466]     Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
[1467]     Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
[1468]     Look you, I'll go pray.
[1469]     Looking before and after, gave us not
[1470]     Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac'd,
[1471]     Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at
[1472]     Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
[1473]     Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
[1474]     Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
[1475]     Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
[1476]     Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.         Exeunt.
[1477]     Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
[1478]     Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
[1479]     Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
[1480]     Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
[1481]     Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
[1482]     Make you to ravel all this matter out,
[1483]     Makes mouths at the invisible event,  
[1484]     Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
[1485]     Makes vow before his uncle never more
[1486]     Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
[1487]     Marcellus?
[1488]     Mark the encounter. If he love her not,
[1489]     Mark you,
[1490]     May be a devil; and the devil hath power
[1491]     May do t' express his love and friending to you,
[1492]     May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
[1493]     May give his saying deed; which is no further
[1494]     May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
[1495]     May sweep to my revenge.
[1496]     May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
[1497]     Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.
[1498]     Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
[1499]     Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
[1500]     Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
[1501]     Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
[1502]     More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
[1503]     More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
[1504]     More relative than this. The play's the thing
[1505]     More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
[1506]     More than in words?
[1507]     Moreover that we much did long to see you,
[1508]     Most free in his reply.
[1509]     Most generous, and free from all contriving,
[1510]     Most holy and religious fear it is
[1511]     Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
[1512]     Most throughly for my father.
[1513]     Most welcome home!                       Exeunt Ambassadors.
[1514]     Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
[1515]     Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
[1516]     Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
[1517]     Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
[1518]     Must give us pause. There's the respect
[1519]     Must render up myself.
[1520]     My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
[1521]     My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
[1522]     My custom always of the afternoon,
[1523]     My father's brother, but no more like my father
[1524]     My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
[1525]     My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
[1526]     My father- methinks I see my father.
[1527]     My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
[1528]     My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome to
[1529]     My head should be struck off.
[1530]     My liege, and madam, to expostulate
[1531]     My lord, not I.
[1532]     My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
[1533]     My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
[1534]     My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
[1535]     My soul is full of discord and dismay.
[1536]     My stern effects. Then what I have to do
[1537]     My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
[1538]     My tables! Meet it is I set it down
[1539]     My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
[1540]     My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!            Exit.
[1541]     My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
[1542]     My too much changed son.- Go, some of you,
[1543]     My uncle?
[1544]     My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
[1545]     Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
[1546]     Nay, come, let's go together.  
[1547]     Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
[1548]     Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
[1549]     Never to speak of this that you have heard:
[1550]     New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
[1551]     Next, Your son gone, and he most violent author
[1552]     No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
[1553]     No hat upon his head, his stockings foul'd,
[1554]     No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
[1555]     No medicine in the world can do thee good.
[1556]     No more to undertake it, I will work him
[1557]     No more, sweet Hamlet!
[1558]     No more.
[1559]     No more; and by a sleep to say we end
[1560]     No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
[1561]     No reckoning made, but sent to my account
[1562]     No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
[1563]     No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
[1564]     No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
[1565]     No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
[1566]     No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
[1567]     No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
[1568]     No.
[1569]     Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
[1570]     Nor customary suits of solemn black,
[1571]     Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
[1572]     Nor shall you do my ear that violence
[1573]     Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
[1574]     Nor thine on me!                                       Dies.
[1575]     Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
[1576]     Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
[1577]     Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
[1578]     Not of that dye which their investments show,
[1579]     Not shriving time allow'd.
[1580]     Now I am alone.  
[1581]     Now fear I this will give it start again;
[1582]     Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
[1583]     Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
[1584]     Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
[1585]     Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
[1586]     Now wears his crown.
[1587]     Now, out of this-
[1588]     O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
[1589]     O good Horatio, what a wounded name
[1590]     O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
[1591]     O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
[1592]     O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
[1593]     O heavy burthen!
[1594]     O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
[1595]     O most pernicious woman!
[1596]     O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
[1597]     O thou vile king,
[1598]     O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
[1599]     O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
[1600]     O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
[1601]     O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
[1602]     O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
[1603]     O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
[1604]     O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
[1605]     O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,  
[1606]     O, ho!
[1607]     O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
[1608]     O, say!
[1609]     O, speak!
[1610]     O, step between her and her fighting soul
[1611]     O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
[1612]     O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why do
[1613]     O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
[1614]     O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
[1615]     O, vengeance!
[1616]     O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy. I
[1617]     Observe my uncle. If his occulted guilt
[1618]     Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
[1619]     Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it,
[1620]     Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
[1621]     Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
[1622]     Of all their conference. If she find him not,
[1623]     Of bell and burial.
[1624]     Of blue Olympus.
[1625]     Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
[1626]     Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
[1627]     Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
[1628]     Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
[1629]     Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
[1630]     Of general assault.  
[1631]     Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
[1632]     Of him that brought them.
[1633]     Of his affection to me.
[1634]     Of his behaviour.
[1635]     Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
[1636]     Of his true state.
[1637]     Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
[1638]     Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
[1639]     Of man and country-
[1640]     Of mighty opposites.
[1641]     Of mine own eyes.  
[1642]     Of my true mother.
[1643]     Of the unworthiest siege.
[1644]     Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]
[1645]     Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
[1646]     Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
[1647]     Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
[1648]     Of those effects for which I did the murther-
[1649]     Of unimproved mettle hot and full,  
[1650]     Of your dear father's death, is't writ in Your revenge
[1651]     Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
[1652]     Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
[1653]     Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
[1654]     On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.
[1655]     On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,
[1656]     On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
[1657]     On plots and errors happen.
[1658]     On such regards of safety and allowance
[1659]     One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
[1660]     One word more, good lady.
[1661]     Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
[1662]     Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
[1663]     Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
[1664]     Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
[1665]     Or but a sickly part of one true sense
[1666]     Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
[1667]     Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
[1668]     Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
[1669]     Or for some frontier?
[1670]     Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
[1671]     Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
[1672]     Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
[1673]     Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?  
[1674]     Or like a creature native and indued
[1675]     Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
[1676]     Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
[1677]     Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
[1678]     Or not at all.
[1679]     Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
[1680]     Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
[1681]     Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
[1682]     Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
[1683]     Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
[1684]     Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd  
[1685]     Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
[1686]     Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
[1687]     Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
[1688]     Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
[1689]     Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
[1690]     Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
[1691]     Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
[1692]     Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
[1693]     Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
[1694]     Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
[1695]     Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,
[1696]     Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
[1697]     Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
[1698]     Out of his lunacies.
[1699]     Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
[1700]     Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
[1701]     Out of the shot and danger of desire.
[1702]     Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
[1703]     Over the nasty sty!
[1704]     Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
[1705]     Passing through nature to eternity.  
[1706]     Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
[1707]     Perchance 'twill walk again.
[1708]     Perpend.
[1709]     Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
[1710]     Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
[1711]     Play something like the murther of my father
[1712]     Pleasant and helpful to him!
[1713]     Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
[1714]     Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
[1715]     Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
[1716]     Pray you be round with him.
[1717]     Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
[1718]     Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
[1719]     Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
[1720]     Pursued my life.
[1721]     Put your dread pleasures more into command
[1722]     Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
[1723]     Queen. O, confound the rest!
[1724]     Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,  
[1725]     Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
[1726]     Queen. The instances that second marriage move
[1727]     Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
[1728]     Receiv'd his love?
[1729]     Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
[1730]     Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
[1731]     Repast them with my blood.
[1732]     Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
[1733]     Requite him for your father.  
[1734]     Resembles that it was. What it should be,
[1735]     Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
[1736]     Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
[1737]     Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
[1738]     Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
[1739]     Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.  
[1740]     Richer than that which four successive kings
[1741]     Rome-
[1742]     Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
[1743]     Rough-hew them how we will-
[1744]     Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
[1745]     Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.  
[1746]     Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
[1747]     Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
[1748]     Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
[1749]     See what a grace was seated on this brow;
[1750]     See you now-
[1751]     Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
[1752]     Seem to me all the uses of this world!
[1753]     Set your entreatments at a higher rate
[1754]     Shall in the general censure take corruption
[1755]     Shall you my son. You have me, have you not
[1756]     Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
[1757]     Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
[1758]     She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
[1759]     She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
[1760]     She turns to favour and to prettiness.
[1761]     She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
[1762]     Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
[1763]     Should have a back or second, that might hold
[1764]     Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
[1765]     Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
[1766]     Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
[1767]     Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
[1768]     Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
[1769]     Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
[1770]     Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
[1771]     Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
[1772]     Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
[1773]     Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
[1774]     Sir, in this audience,
[1775]     Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
[1776]     Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
[1777]     Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
[1778]     Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
[1779]     So bloodily hast struck.
[1780]     So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
[1781]     So crimeful and so capital in nature,
[1782]     So excellent a king, that was to this
[1783]     So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
[1784]     So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
[1785]     So full of artless jealousy is guilt
[1786]     So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
[1787]     So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
[1788]     So horridly to shake our disposition
[1789]     So levied as before, against the Polack;
[1790]     So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
[1791]     So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
[1792]     So much as from occasion you may glean,  
[1793]     So much from th' understanding of himself,
[1794]     So nightly toils the subject of the land,
[1795]     So oft it chances in particular men
[1796]     So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
[1797]     So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
[1798]     So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
[1799]     So, by my former lecture and advice,
[1800]     So, proceed you.
[1801]     So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
[1802]     Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
[1803]     Some little time; so by your companies
[1804]     Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
[1805]     Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
[1806]     Speak loudly for him.
[1807]     Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
[1808]     Speak to her, Hamlet.
[1809]     Speak to me.
[1810]     Speak to me.  
[1811]     Speak, man.
[1812]     Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
[1813]     Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
[1814]     Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
[1815]     Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
[1816]     Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
[1817]     Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
[1818]     Stick fiery off indeed.
[1819]     Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
[1820]     Stood challenger on mount of all the age
[1821]     Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
[1822]     Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
[1823]     Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?  
[1824]     Such was the very armour he had on
[1825]     Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
[1826]     Swear by my sword.
[1827]     Swear by my sword.
[1828]     Swear.
[1829]     T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
[1830]     T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
[1831]     T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
[1832]     Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
[1833]     Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
[1834]     Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
[1835]     Take these again; for to the noble mind
[1836]     Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
[1837]     Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
[1838]     Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
[1839]     Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
[1840]     Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
[1841]     Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
[1842]     Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
[1843]     Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
[1844]     Th' effect of what I wrote?
[1845]     Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
[1846]     Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
[1847]     Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
[1848]     Th' important acting of your dread command?
[1849]     Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
[1850]     Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
[1851]     Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
[1852]     Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
[1853]     Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
[1854]     Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
[1855]     Than fly to others that we know not of?
[1856]     Than is my deed to my most painted word.
[1857]     Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
[1858]     Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
[1859]     Than that which dearest father bears his son
[1860]     Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
[1861]     Than to entreaty.
[1862]     Than your particular demands will touch it.
[1863]     That I am guiltless of your father's death,
[1864]     That I essentially am not in madness,
[1865]     That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
[1866]     That I have longed long to re-deliver.
[1867]     That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
[1868]     That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
[1869]     That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
[1870]     That I might be the organ.
[1871]     That I must be their scourge and minister.
[1872]     That I must call't in question.
[1873]     That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
[1874]     That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
[1875]     That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
[1876]     That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
[1877]     That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
[1878]     That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
[1879]     That are but mutes or audience to this act,
[1880]     That are so fortified against our story,
[1881]     That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
[1882]     That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
[1883]     That both the world, I give to negligence,
[1884]     That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
[1885]     That capability and godlike reason
[1886]     That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
[1887]     That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
[1888]     That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
[1889]     That ever I was born to set it right!
[1890]     That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
[1891]     That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation  
[1892]     That for a fantasy and trick of fame
[1893]     That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
[1894]     That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
[1895]     That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
[1896]     That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
[1897]     That has no relish of salvation in't-
[1898]     That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
[1899]     That hath in it no profit but the name.
[1900]     That have a father klll'd, a mother stain'd,
[1901]     That he could nothing do but wish and beg
[1902]     That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
[1903]     That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
[1904]     That he is open to incontinency.
[1905]     That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
[1906]     That he should weep for her? What would he do,
[1907]     That he which hath your noble father slain
[1908]     That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
[1909]     That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
[1910]     That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
[1911]     That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
[1912]     That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
[1913]     That it might please you to give quiet pass
[1914]     That it went hand in hand even with the vow
[1915]     That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
[1916]     That live and feed upon your Majesty.
[1917]     That looks so many fadoms to the sea
[1918]     That makes calamity of so long life.
[1919]     That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
[1920]     That might your nature, honour, and exception
[1921]     That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
[1922]     That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
[1923]     That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
[1924]     That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
[1925]     That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
[1926]     That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
[1927]     That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
[1928]     That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
[1929]     That she should lock herself from his resort,
[1930]     That show of such an exercise may colour
[1931]     That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
[1932]     That so his sickness, age, and impotence
[1933]     That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
[1934]     That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
[1935]     That swift as quicksilverr it courses through
[1936]     That swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe,
[1937]     That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
[1938]     That they do know my son, come you more nearer
[1939]     That they may seem the taints of liberty,
[1940]     That thou so many princes at a shot
[1941]     That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
[1942]     That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
[1943]     That thus he suffers for.
[1944]     That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
[1945]     That to Laertes I forgot myself,
[1946]     That to the use of actions fair and good
[1947]     That treason can but peep to what it would,
[1948]     That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
[1949]     That was and is the question of these wars.
[1950]     That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
[1951]     That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
[1952]     That we find out the cause of this effect-
[1953]     That we with wisest sorrow think on him
[1954]     That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
[1955]     That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
[1956]     That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
[1957]     That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
[1958]     That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
[1959]     That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
[1960]     That your good beauties be the happy cause
[1961]     That youth and observation copied there,
[1962]     That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
[1963]     That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
[1964]     That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,  
[1965]     That, being of so young clays brought up with him,
[1966]     That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
[1967]     That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
[1968]     That, if again this apparition come,
[1969]     That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
[1970]     That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
[1971]     That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
[1972]     That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
[1973]     Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
[1974]     The Devil himself.
[1975]     The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
[1976]     The King is a thing-
[1977]     The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
[1978]     The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
[1979]     The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
[1980]     The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms? I'll
[1981]     The apparition comes. I knew your father.
[1982]     The bark is ready and the wind at help,
[1983]     The bell then beating one-
[1984]     The better to beguile. This is for all:
[1985]     The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
[1986]     The canker galls the infants of the spring
[1987]     The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
[1988]     The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
[1989]     The changeling never known. Now, the next day  
[1990]     The chariest maid is prodigal enough
[1991]     The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
[1992]     The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
[1993]     The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
[1994]     The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
[1995]     The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
[1996]     The death I gave him. So again, good night.
[1997]     The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]
[1998]     The ears are senseless that should give us bearing
[1999]     The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
[2000]     The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look
[2001]     The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
[2002]     The form of plausive manners, that these men
[2003]     The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
[2004]     The glowworm shows the matin to be near
[2005]     The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
[2006]     The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
[2007]     The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
[2008]     The head and source of all your son's distemper.
[2009]     The head is not more native to the heart,
[2010]     The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
[2011]     The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
[2012]     The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
[2013]     The imminent death of twenty thousand men
[2014]     The insolence of office, and the spurns
[2015]     The inward service of the mind and soul
[2016]     The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
[2017]     The leperous distilment; whose effect
[2018]     The light and careless livery that it wears
[2019]     The lists, and full proportions are all made
[2020]     The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
[2021]     The memory be green, and that it us befitted
[2022]     The natural gates and alleys of the body,
[2023]     The need we have to use you did provoke
[2024]     The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
[2025]     The ocean, overpeering of his list,
[2026]     The origin and commencement of his grief
[2027]     The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
[2028]     The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
[2029]     The pith and marrow of our attribute.
[2030]     The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
[2031]     The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
[2032]     The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;  
[2033]     The rather, if you could devise it so
[2034]     The ratifiers and props of every word,
[2035]     The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
[2036]     The safety and health of this whole state,
[2037]     The serpent that did sting thy father's life
[2038]     The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
[2039]     The soldiers' music and the rites of war
[2040]     The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
[2041]     The source of this our watch, and the chief head
[2042]     The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
[2043]     The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
[2044]     The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
[2045]     The terms of our estate may not endure
[2046]     The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
[2047]     The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
[2048]     The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
[2049]     The triumph of his pledge.
[2050]     The trumpet to the cannoneer without,  
[2051]     The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
[2052]     The unseen good old man.
[2053]     The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
[2054]     The very faculties of eyes and ears.
[2055]     The very place puts toys of desperation,
[2056]     The very soul, and sweet religion makes
[2057]     The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
[2058]     The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
[2059]     The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
[2060]     The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
[2061]     The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
[2062]     Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
[2063]     Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
[2064]     Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
[2065]     Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
[2066]     Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
[2067]     Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
[2068]     Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
[2069]     Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
[2070]     Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
[2071]     There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
[2072]     There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
[2073]     There is a play to-night before the King.
[2074]     There is no shuffling; there the action lies
[2075]     There lives within the very flame of love
[2076]     There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
[2077]     There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
[2078]     There with fantastic garlands did she come
[2079]     There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
[2080]     There's such divinity doth hedge a king
[2081]     There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
[2082]     There, my lord.
[2083]     Therefore I have entreated him along,  
[2084]     Therefore let's follow.
[2085]     Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
[2086]     Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
[2087]     Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
[2088]     These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
[2089]     These hands are not more like.
[2090]     These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
[2091]     They are not near my conscience; their defeat
[2092]     They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
[2093]     They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
[2094]     They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
[2095]     They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
[2096]     They had begun the play. I sat me down;
[2097]     They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
[2098]     They shall go far with little.  
[2099]     They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
[2100]     Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
[2101]     Thin settled age his sables and his weeds,
[2102]     This above all- to thine own self be true,
[2103]     This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
[2104]     This bodiless creation ecstasy
[2105]     This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
[2106]     This grave shall have a living monument.
[2107]     This heavy-headed revel east and west
[2108]     This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
[2109]     This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
[2110]     This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
[2111]     This is the very ecstasy of love,
[2112]     This mad young man. But so much was our love
[2113]     This man shall set me packing.
[2114]     This marvel to you.
[2115]     This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
[2116]     This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
[2117]     This night to play before him.
[2118]     This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Exit.
[2119]     This presence knows,
[2120]     This present object made probation.
[2121]     This something-settled matter in his heart,
[2122]     This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
[2123]     This sudden sending him away must seem
[2124]     This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
[2125]     This unprevailing woe, and think of us
[2126]     This warlike volley.
[2127]     This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
[2128]     This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
[2129]     Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
[2130]     Thou canst not then be false to any man.
[2131]     Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
[2132]     Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
[2133]     Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
[2134]     Thou know'st already.
[2135]     Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright  
[2136]     Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
[2137]     Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
[2138]     Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
[2139]     Though inclination be as sharp as will.
[2140]     Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
[2141]     Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
[2142]     Through your dominions for this enterprise,
[2143]     Thrown out his angle for my Proper life,
[2144]     Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
[2145]     Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,  
[2146]     Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
[2147]     Thus much the business is: we have here writ
[2148]     Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
[2149]     Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
[2150]     Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
[2151]     Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
[2152]     Till by some elder masters of known honour
[2153]     Till of this flat a mountain you have made
[2154]     Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
[2155]     Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
[2156]     Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
[2157]     Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
[2158]     Till then in patience our proceeding be.
[2159]     Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
[2160]     Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
[2161]     To England send him; or confine him where
[2162]     To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
[2163]     To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
[2164]     To any pastime?
[2165]     To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,  
[2166]     To be commanded.
[2167]     To be contracted in one brow of woe,
[2168]     To be forestalled ere we come to fall,  
[2169]     To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
[2170]     To both your honours.
[2171]     To business with the King, more than the scope
[2172]     To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
[2173]     To cast thee up again. What may this mean  
[2174]     To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever  
[2175]     To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me.
[2176]     To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
[2177]     To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
[2178]     To exploit now ripe in my device,
[2179]     To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
[2180]     To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
[2181]     To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
[2182]     To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
[2183]     To give it due content.
[2184]     To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.
[2185]     To give the world assurance of a man.
[2186]     To give them seals never, my soul, consent!             Exit.
[2187]     To give these mourning duties to your father;
[2188]     To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
[2189]     To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
[2190]     To hear and see the matter.
[2191]     To hear him so inclin'd.
[2192]     To hear of it. They are here about the court,
[2193]     To hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him home;
[2194]     To heaven.
[2195]     To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
[2196]     To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
[2197]     To him from whom you brought them.                   Exeunt.
[2198]     To his confine; and of the truth herein
[2199]     To his unmast'red importunity.
[2200]     To keep it from divulging, let it feed
[2201]     To keep itself from noyance; but much more
[2202]     To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
[2203]     To keep those many many bodies safe
[2204]     To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
[2205]     To lay our service freely at your feet,
[2206]     To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
[2207]     To let this canker of our nature come
[2208]     To let you know of it.
[2209]     To make it truster of your own report
[2210]     To make oppression bitter, or ere this
[2211]     To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;  
[2212]     To mine own room again; making so bold  
[2213]     To muddy death.
[2214]     To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
[2215]     To offer it the show of violence;
[2216]     To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
[2217]     To outface me with leaping in her grave?
[2218]     To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
[2219]     To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
[2220]     To punish me with this, and this with me,
[2221]     To put an antic disposition on),  
[2222]     To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
[2223]     To reason most absurd, whose common theme
[2224]     To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
[2225]     To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
[2226]     To show my duty in your coronation,  
[2227]     To show us so much gentry and good will
[2228]     To show yourself your father's son in deed
[2229]     To sing a requiem and such rest to her
[2230]     To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
[2231]     To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
[2232]     To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
[2233]     To take him in the purging of his soul,
[2234]     To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
[2235]     To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]
[2236]     To tell the secrets of my prison house,
[2237]     To tell us this.
[2238]     To the ambassadors of England gives
[2239]     To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
[2240]     To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
[2241]     To the unsatisfied.
[2242]     To those of mine!
[2243]     To try conclusions, in the basket creep
[2244]     To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
[2245]     To what I shall unfold.
[2246]     To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
[2247]     To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
[2248]     To you alone.
[2249]     To you in satisfaction; but if not,  
[2250]     To you yourself, to us, to every one.  
[2251]     To youth and liberty.
[2252]     Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
[2253]     Together with remembrance of ourselves.
[2254]     Together with that fair and warlike form
[2255]     Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
[2256]     Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
[2257]     Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
[2258]     Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
[2259]     Treachery! Seek it out.
[2260]     Truly deliver.
[2261]     Try what repentance can. What can it not?
[2262]     Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
[2263]     Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice
[2264]     Under the moon, can save the thing from death
[2265]     Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
[2266]     Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
[2267]     Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
[2268]     Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
[2269]     Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
[2270]     Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
[2271]     Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
[2272]     Unto our climature and countrymen.
[2273]     Unto that element; but long it could not be
[2274]     Unto the voice and yielding of that body
[2275]     Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
[2276]     Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
[2277]     Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
[2278]     Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor  
[2279]     Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
[2280]     Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
[2281]     Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
[2282]     Upon the beat and flame of thy distemper
[2283]     Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
[2284]     Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
[2285]     Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
[2286]     Upon whose property and most dear life
[2287]     Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
[2288]     Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
[2289]     Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
[2290]     Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
[2291]     Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
[2292]     Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
[2293]     Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
[2294]     Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
[2295]     Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
[2296]     Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
[2297]     Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
[2298]     Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
[2299]     We cannot get from him.  
[2300]     We do it wrong, being so majestical,
[2301]     We go to gain a little patch of ground
[2302]     We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
[2303]     We may of their encounter frankly judge
[2304]     We must with all our majesty and skill
[2305]     We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
[2306]     We shall express our duty in his eye;
[2307]     We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
[2308]     We should profane the service of the dead
[2309]     We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book,
[2310]     We would not understand what was most fit,
[2311]     We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
[2312]     We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
[2313]     We'll put the matter to the present push.-
[2314]     We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
[2315]     Weigh what convenience both of time and means
[2316]     Welcome, my good friends.
[2317]     Well may it sort that this portentous figure
[2318]     Well ratified by law and heraldry,
[2319]     Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
[2320]     Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
[2321]     What I have said to you.
[2322]     What company, at what expense; and finding
[2323]     What does this mean, my lord?
[2324]     What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
[2325]     What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
[2326]     What is between you? Give me up the truth.
[2327]     What is the issue of the business there.  
[2328]     What is the matter?
[2329]     What is the reason that you use me thus?
[2330]     What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
[2331]     What majesty should be, what duty is,
[2332]     What might be toward, that this sweaty haste  
[2333]     What might you think? No, I went round to work
[2334]     What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
[2335]     What think you on't?
[2336]     What thou hast said to me.
[2337]     What warlike noise is this?
[2338]     What we two nights have seen.
[2339]     What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
[2340]     What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
[2341]     What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
[2342]     What, have you given him any hard words of late?
[2343]     What, is Horatio there ?
[2344]     When I had seen this hot love on the wing
[2345]     When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
[2346]     When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
[2347]     When down her weedy trophies and herself
[2348]     When he himself might his quietus make
[2349]     When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
[2350]     When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?  
[2351]     When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
[2352]     When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
[2353]     When in one line two crafts directly meet.  
[2354]     When in your motion you are hot and dry-  
[2355]     When it prov'd otherwise.?
[2356]     When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
[2357]     When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
[2358]     When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,  
[2359]     When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
[2360]     When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
[2361]     When thou liest howling.
[2362]     When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
[2363]     When we would bring him on to some confession
[2364]     When yond same star that's westward from the pole
[2365]     Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
[2366]     Where every god did seem to set his seal
[2367]     Where is your son?
[2368]     Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
[2369]     Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
[2370]     Where should We have our thanks?
[2371]     Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
[2372]     Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
[2373]     Where we shall find him most conveniently.           Exeunt.
[2374]     Where you may see the inmost part of you.
[2375]     Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
[2376]     Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.         Exit.
[2377]     Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
[2378]     Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
[2379]     Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
[2380]     Wherein they say you shine, Your sun of parts
[2381]     Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
[2382]     Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
[2383]     Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
[2384]     Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
[2385]     Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
[2386]     Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
[2387]     Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
[2388]     Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
[2389]     Which I have told thee, of my father's death.  
[2390]     Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
[2391]     Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
[2392]     Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
[2393]     Which have solicited- the rest is silence.             Dies.
[2394]     Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
[2395]     Which is not tomb enough and continent
[2396]     Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
[2397]     Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
[2398]     Which may to you, perhaps, seein much unsinew'd,
[2399]     Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
[2400]     Which now goes too free-footed.
[2401]     Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
[2402]     Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
[2403]     Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
[2404]     Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
[2405]     Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
[2406]     Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
[2407]     Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
[2408]     Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
[2409]     Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
[2410]     Who hath reliev'd you?
[2411]     Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
[2412]     Who is't that can inform me?
[2413]     Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
[2414]     Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
[2415]     Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
[2416]     Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
[2417]     Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
[2418]     Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
[2419]     Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
[2420]     Whose motive in this case should stir me most
[2421]     Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
[2422]     Whose violent property fordoes itself  
[2423]     Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
[2424]     Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
[2425]     Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
[2426]     Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
[2427]     Why does the drum come hither?
[2428]     Why seems it so particular with thee?
[2429]     Why should we in our peevish opposition
[2430]     Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
[2431]     Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
[2432]     Why this same strict and most observant watch
[2433]     Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
[2434]     Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
[2435]     Why to a public count I might not go
[2436]     Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
[2437]     Why you proceeded not against these feats
[2438]     Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
[2439]     Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
[2440]     Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
[2441]     Will bring him to his wonted way again,
[2442]     Will not debate the question of this straw.
[2443]     Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
[2444]     Will nothing stick Our person to arraign
[2445]     Will return'd shall know you are come home.
[2446]     Will sate itself in a celestial bed
[2447]     Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
[2448]     Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
[2449]     Will you be rul'd by me?

[2454]     With all my imperfections on my head.
[2455]     With all my love I do commend me to you;
[2456]     With all the strength and armour of the mind
[2457]     With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
[2458]     With an attent ear, till I may deliver

[2474]     With this regard their currents turn awry
[2475]     With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!
[2476]     With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
[2477]     With tristful visage, as against the doom,
[2478]     With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?

[2482]     With windlasses and with assays of bias,
[2483]     With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
[2484]     With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
[2485]     With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-

[2500]     Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,

[2507]     Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
[2508]     Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,

[2518]     Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
[2519]     Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
[2520]     Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
[2521]     Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
[2522]     Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
[2523]     You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
[2524]     You are the most immediate to our throne,
[2525]     You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see thee
[2526]     You cannot call it love; for at your age
[2527]     You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
[2528]     You do not understand yourself so clearly
[2529]     You do remember all the circumstance?
[2530]     You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
[2531]     You go not till I set you up a glass
[2532]     You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
[2533]     You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
[2534]     You know the wager?
[2535]     You laying these slight sullies on my son
[2536]     You mainly were stirr'd up.
[2537]     You must not put another scandal on him,
[2538]     You must not take for fire. From this time
[2539]     You must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.
[2540]     You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
[2541]     You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
[2542]     You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?
[2543]     You, as your business and desires shall point you,
[2544]     You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
[2545]     Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
[2546]     Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;
[2547]     Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
[2548]     Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone  
[2549]     Your leave and favour to return to France;
[2550]     Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
[2551]     Your party in converse, him you would sound,
[2552]     Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,

[3144]   Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start
[3145]   Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
[3146]   Guil. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
[3147]   Guil. Heavens make our presence and our practices
[3148]   Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
[3149]   Guil. In what, my dear lord?
[3150]   Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.  
[3151]   Guil. My honour'd lord!
[3152]   Guil. My lord, I cannot.
[3153]   Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
[3154]   Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
[3155]   Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
[3156]   Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
[3157]   Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
[3158]   Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
[3159]   Guil. Prison, my lord?  
[3160]   Guil. The King, sir-
[3161]   Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit
[3162]   Guil. There are the players.
[3163]   Guil. We will ourselves provide.
[3164]   Guil. What should we say, my lord?
[3165]   Guil. What, my lord?
[3166]   Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of
[3167]   Guildenstern, courtier.
[3168]   Ham.   A whole one I!
[3169]   Ham.   Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
[3170]   Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
[3171]   Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
[3172]   Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
[3173]   Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
[3174]   Ham. 'The mobled queen'?
[3175]   Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the daintier
[3176]   Ham. 'Tis very strange.
[3177]   Ham. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.-
[3178]   Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
[3179]   Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
[3180]   Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
[3181]   Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
[3182]   Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
[3183]   Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
[3184]   Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
[3185]   Ham. Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
[3186]   Ham. Alas, poor ghost!
[3187]   Ham. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
[3188]   Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
[3189]   Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
[3190]   Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
[3191]   Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
[3192]   Ham. And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
[3193]   Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
[3194]   Ham. Are you fair?
[3195]   Ham. Arm'd, say you?
[3196]   Ham. As th'art a man,
[3197]   Ham. As woman's love.
[3198]   Ham. At supper.
[3199]   Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
[3200]   Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
[3201]   Ham. Ay, marry, is't;
[3202]   Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
[3203]   Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to
[3204]   Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is something
[3205]   Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
[3206]   Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
[3207]   Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,  
[3208]   Ham. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
[3209]   Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
[3210]   Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
[3211]   Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;
[3212]   Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
[3213]   Ham. Between who?
[3214]   Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
[3215]   Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
[3216]   Ham. But where was this?
[3217]   Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
[3218]   Ham. Buzz, buzz!
[3219]   Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
[3220]   Ham. Come on, sir.
[3221]   Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge I
[3222]   Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
[3223]   Ham. Denmark's a prison.
[3224]   Ham. Did you not speak to it?
[3225]   Ham. Do not believe it.
[3226]   Ham. Do the boys carry it away?  
[3227]   Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
[3228]   Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
[3229]   Ham. Do you see nothing there?
[3230]   Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
[3231]   Ham. Do you think I meant country matters?
[3232]   Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
[3233]   Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th' earth?
[3234]   Ham. Ecstasy?
[3235]   Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
[3236]   Ham. Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the air,
[3237]   Ham. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
[3238]   Ham. For England?
[3239]   Ham. For God's love let me hear!
[3240]   Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god  
[3241]   Ham. From top to toe?
[3242]   Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'
[3243]   Ham. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
[3244]   Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
[3245]   Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
[3246]   Ham. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
[3247]   Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
[3248]   Ham. Good madam!
[3249]   Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
[3250]   Ham. Good.  
[3251]   Ham. Ha, ha! Are you honest?
[3252]   Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
[3253]   Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
[3254]   Ham. Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
[3255]   Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,
[3256]   Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago.  
[3257]   Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
[3258]   Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
[3259]   Ham. He will stay till you come.
[3260]   Ham. Hear you, sir!
[3261]   Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
[3262]   Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
[3263]   Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
[3264]   Ham. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
[3265]   Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
[3266]   Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
[3267]   Ham. Hold off your hands!
[3268]   Ham. Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
[3269]   Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
[3270]   Ham. How came he mad?
[3271]   Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
[3272]   Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
[3273]   Ham. How does the Queen?
[3274]   Ham. How if I answer no?
[3275]   Ham. How is it with you, lady?
[3276]   Ham. How long is that since?
[3277]   Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
[3278]   Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
[3279]   Ham. How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
[3280]   Ham. How strangely?
[3281]   Ham. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I
[3282]   Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.
[3283]   Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
[3284]   Ham. I am glad to see you well.
[3285]   Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
[3286]   Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
[3287]   Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-  
[3288]   Ham. I beseech you remember.
[3289]   Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
[3290]   Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
[3291]   Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
[3292]   Ham. I do beseech you.
[3293]   Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been in
[3294]   Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
[3295]   Ham. I embrace it freely,
[3296]   Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
[3297]   Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;
[3298]   Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
[3299]   Ham. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
[3300]   Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
[3301]   Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap?
[3302]   Ham. I must to England; you know that?
[3303]   Ham. I pray you.
[3304]   Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
[3305]   Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
[3306]   Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
[3307]   Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
[3308]   Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.-
[3309]   Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your
[3310]   Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
[3311]   Ham. I will watch to-night.
[3312]   Ham. I will.
[3313]   Ham. I would I had been there.
[3314]   Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
[3315]   Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
[3316]   Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.  
[3317]   Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
[3318]   Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
[3319]   Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
[3320]   Ham. If she should break it now!
[3321]   Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
[3322]   Ham. In happy time.
[3323]   Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not
[3324]   Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
[3325]   Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
[3326]   Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
[3327]   Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
[3328]   Ham. Into my grave?
[3329]   Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
[3330]   Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
[3331]   Ham. Is't possible?
[3332]   Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
[3333]   Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
[3334]   Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
[3335]   Ham. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on.
[3336]   Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be
[3337]   Ham. It waves me still.
[3338]   Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
[3339]   Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
[3340]   Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
[3341]   Ham. Judgment!
[3342]   Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
[3343]   Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
[3344]   Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him,  
[3345]   Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
[3346]   Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
[3347]   Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
[3348]   Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
[3349]   Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.  
[3350]   Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
[3351]   Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
[3352]   Ham. Murther?
[3353]   Ham. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
[3354]   Ham. My fate cries out
[3355]   Ham. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
[3356]   Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
[3357]   Ham. Nay come! again!                         The Queen falls.  
[3358]   Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
[3359]   Ham. Nay, I know not.
[3360]   Ham. Nay, but swear't.
[3361]   Ham. Nay, but to live
[3362]   Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter;
[3363]   Ham. Nay, that follows not.
[3364]   Ham. Never make known what you have seen to-night.
[3365]   Ham. Never to speak of this that you have seen.
[3366]   Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
[3367]   Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
[3368]   Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
[3369]   Ham. No, by this bad.  
[3370]   Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
[3371]   Ham. No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.
[3372]   Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' th'
[3373]   Ham. No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
[3374]   Ham. No, not I!
[3375]   Ham. No, you will reveal it.
[3376]   Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
[3377]   Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe?
[3378]   Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
[3379]   Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
[3380]   Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
[3381]   Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
[3382]   Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
[3383]   Ham. Nothing.
[3384]   Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
[3385]   Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
[3386]   Ham. O God!
[3387]   Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
[3388]   Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
[3389]   Ham. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
[3390]   Ham. O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
[3391]   Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
[3392]   Ham. O my prophetic soul!
[3393]   Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
[3394]   Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
[3395]   Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no
[3396]   Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
[3397]   Ham. O, but she'll keep her word.
[3398]   Ham. O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
[3399]   Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns
[3400]   Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
[3401]   Ham. Of him, sir.
[3402]   Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
[3403]   Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
[3404]   Ham. One.
[3405]   Ham. Or like a whale.
[3406]   Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
[3407]   Ham. Pale or red?
[3408]   Ham. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
[3409]   Ham. Safely stow'd.
[3410]   Ham. Saw? who?
[3411]   Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
[3412]   Ham. She well instructs me.
[3413]   Ham. Sir, I cannot.
[3414]   Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
[3415]   Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty,
[3416]   Ham. Sir, a whole history.
[3417]   Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I  
[3418]   Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
[3419]   Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
[3420]   Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
[3421]   Ham. So be it!
[3422]   Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
[3423]   Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
[3424]   Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox, leave
[3425]   Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
[3426]   Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
[3427]   Ham. Such an act
[3428]   Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
[3429]   Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
[3430]   Ham. That is Laertes,
[3431]   Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the
[3432]   Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
[3433]   Ham. That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
[3434]   Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.
[3435]   Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
[3436]   Ham. The King my father?
[3437]   Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
[3438]   Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.
[3439]   Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
[3440]   Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
[3441]   Ham. The point envenom'd too?
[3442]   Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
[3443]   Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
[3444]   Ham. Then came each actor on his ass-
[3445]   Ham. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
[3446]   Ham. Then saw you not his face?
[3447]   Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to the
[3448]   Ham. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
[3449]   Ham. There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
[3450]   Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
[3451]   Ham. There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
[3452]   Ham. These tedious old fools!
[3453]   Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.  
[3454]   Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I  
[3455]   Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
[3456]   Ham. This?
[3457]   Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis for
[3458]   Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
[3459]   Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
[3460]   Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:
[3461]   Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
[3462]   Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
[3463]   Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
[3464]   Ham. Up from my cabin,
[3465]   Ham. Upon my sword.
[3466]   Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
[3467]   Ham. Upon what ground?
[3468]   Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?  
[3469]   Ham. Very well, my lord.
[3470]   Ham. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
[3471]   Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel;
[3472]   Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
[3473]   Ham. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
[3474]   Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
[3475]   Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
[3476]   Ham. What call you the carriages?
[3477]   Ham. What did you enact?
[3478]   Ham. What hour now?
[3479]   Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman
[3480]   Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
[3481]   Ham. What woman then?
[3482]   Ham. What's his weapon?
[3483]   Ham. What's the matter now?
[3484]   Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
[3485]   Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
[3486]   Ham. What, ho, Horatio!
[3487]   Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
[3488]   Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
[3489]   Ham. What?
[3490]   Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.
[3491]   Ham. Who commands them, sir?
[3492]   Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
[3493]   Ham. Who, I?
[3494]   Ham. Whose was it?
[3495]   Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
[3496]   Ham. Why he more than another?
[3497]   Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
[3498]   Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
[3499]   Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and knock'd
[3500]   Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
[3501]   Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
[3502]   Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!  
[3503]   Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
[3504]   Ham. Why, right! You are in the right!
[3505]   Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
[3506]   Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
[3507]   Ham. Why, what should be the fear?
[3508]   Ham. Why,
[3509]   Ham. Why,
[3510]   Ham. Why?
[3511]   Ham. With drink, sir?
[3512]   Ham. Words, words, words.
[3513]   Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
[3514]   Ham. You are welcome.
[3515]   Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
[3516]   Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
[3517]   Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
[3518]   Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
[3519]   Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
[3520]   Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a
[3521]   Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
[3522]   Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold
[3523]   Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!
[3524]   Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief  
[3525]   Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
[3526]   Hamlet, son to the former, and nephew to the present king.
[3527]   Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in another
[3528]   Hor. 'Tis here!
[3529]   Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
[3530]   Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.  
[3531]   Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlook'd
[3532]   Hor. (within) My lord, my lord!
[3533]   Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
[3534]   Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
[3535]   Hor. A piece of him.
[3536]   Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
[3537]   Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing  
[3538]   Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;  
[3539]   Hor. As thou art to thyself.
[3540]   Hor. Ay, good my lord.
[3541]   Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
[3542]   Hor. Ay, my lord.
[3543]   Hor. Be rul'd. You shall not go.
[3544]   Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
[3545]   Hor. Custom hath made it in him a Property of easiness.
[3546]   Hor. Do not, my lord!
[3547]   Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
[3548]   Hor. E'en so, my lord.
[3549]   Hor. E'en so.
[3550]   Hor. Friends to this ground.
[3551]   Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
[3552]   Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
[3553]   Hor. Hail to your lordship!
[3554]   Hor. Half a share.
[3555]   Hor. Have after. To what issue wail this come?
[3556]   Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination.
[3557]   Hor. Heaven secure him!
[3558]   Hor. Heaven will direct it.
[3559]   Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your service.
[3560]   Hor. How was this seal'd?
[3561]   Hor. I beseech you.
[3562]   Hor. I did very well note him.
[3563]   Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.  
[3564]   Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
[3565]   Hor. I warr'nt it will.
[3566]   Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their
[3567]   Hor. In faith,
[3568]   Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
[3569]   Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
[3570]   Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
[3571]   Hor. Is it a custom?
[3572]   Hor. Is't possible?
[3573]   Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
[3574]   Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
[3575]   Hor. It might, my lord.
[3576]   Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
[3577]   Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
[3578]   Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
[3579]   Hor. Let him bless thee too.
[3580]   Hor. Let them come in.
[3581]   Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
[3582]   Hor. Most constantly.
[3583]   Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
[3584]   Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
[3585]   Hor. My lord, I did;
[3586]   Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
[3587]   Hor. My lord, the King your father.
[3588]   Hor. Nay, good my lord -
[3589]   Hor. Nay, very pale.
[3590]   Hor. Never believe it.
[3591]   Hor. No, by no means!
[3592]   Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaven!
[3593]   Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
[3594]   Hor. Not from his mouth,
[3595]   Hor. Not when I saw't.
[3596]   Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
[3597]   Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
[3598]   Hor. O, my dear lord!
[3599]   Hor. O, where, my lord?
[3600]   Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
[3601]   Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
[3602]   Hor. Peace! Who comes here?
[3603]   Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.  
[3604]   Hor. Remember it, my lord!
[3605]   Hor. Season your admiration for a while
[3606]   Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
[3607]   Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
[3608]   Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
[3609]   Hor. That can I.
[3610]   Hor. That is most certain.
[3611]   Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
[3612]   Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
[3613]   Hor. There's no offence, my lord.
[3614]   Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
[3615]   Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
[3616]   Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.  
[3617]   Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
[3618]   Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
[3619]   Hor. Very well, my lord.
[3620]   Hor. Well, my lord.
[3621]   Hor. Well, sit we down,
[3622]   Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
[3623]   Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
[3624]   Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
[3625]   Hor. What is it you will see?
[3626]   Hor. What is't, my lord? We will.
[3627]   Hor. What news, my lord?
[3628]   Hor. What's that, my lord?
[3629]   Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
[3630]   Hor. Why, what a king is this!
[3631]   Hor. You might have rhym'd.
[3632]   Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
[3633]   Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent
[3634]   Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
[3635]   Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
[3636]   Horatio, friend to Hamlet.
[3637]   King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
[3638]   King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
[3639]   King. A Norman.
[3640]   King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
[3641]   King. Alas, alas!
[3642]   King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
[3643]   King. Arm you, I pray you, to th', speedy voyage;
[3644]   King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
[3645]   King. At supper? Where?
[3646]   King. Ay, Hamlet.
[3647]   King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
[3648]   King. Bring him before us.
[3649]   King. But how hath she
[3650]   King. But where is he?
[3651]   King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
[3652]   King. Conceit upon her father.
[3653]   King. Dead.
[3654]   King. Do you think 'tis this?
[3655]   King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
[3656]   King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
[3657]   King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
[3658]   King. Gertrude, do not drink.
[3659]   King. Give me some light! Away!
[3660]   King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
[3661]   King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
[3662]   King. Good Laertes,
[3663]   King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
[3664]   King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
[3665]   King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
[3666]   King. He made confession of you;
[3667]   King. How do you, pretty lady?
[3668]   King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
[3669]   King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
[3670]   King. How long hath she been thus?
[3671]   King. How may we try it further?
[3672]   King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
[3673]   King. I do not think't.
[3674]   King. I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are not
[3675]   King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
[3676]   King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
[3677]   King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
[3678]   King. If it be so, Laertes
[3679]   King. It falls right.
[3680]   King. It likes us well;
[3681]   King. It shall be so.
[3682]   King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
[3683]   King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
[3684]   King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
[3685]   King. Let him demand his fill.
[3686]   King. Let's follow, Gertrude.  
[3687]   King. Let's further think of this,
[3688]   King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;  
[3689]   King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
[3690]   King. Not that I know.
[3691]   King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
[3692]   King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
[3693]   King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
[3694]   King. O Gertrude, come away!
[3695]   King. O heavy deed!
[3696]   King. O, for two special reasons,
[3697]   King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
[3698]   King. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.
[3699]   King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
[3700]   King. Our son shall win.
[3701]   King. Part them! They are incens'd.
[3702]   King. Pluck thein asunder.
[3703]   King. Pretty Ophelia!
[3704]   King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
[3705]   King. She sounds to see them bleed.
[3706]   King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
[3707]   King. So you shall;
[3708]   King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
[3709]   King. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
[3710]   King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
[3711]   King. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
[3712]   King. Thanks, dear my lord.
[3713]   King. The doors are broke.
[3714]   King. The very same.
[3715]   King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
[3716]   King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
[3717]   King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
[3718]   King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
[3719]   King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
[3720]   King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
[3721]   King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
[3722]   King. We will try it.
[3723]   King. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
[3724]   King. Well, we shall sift him.
[3725]   King. What do you call the play?
[3726]   King. What dost thou mean by this?  
[3727]   King. What is the cause, Laertes,
[3728]   King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
[3729]   King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
[3730]   King. Where is Polonius?
[3731]   King. Who shall stay you?
[3732]   King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
[3733]   King. Why, now You speak
[3734]   King. Will you know them then?
[3735]   King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
[3736]   King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
[3737]   King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
[3738]   King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
[3739]   Laer. A Norman was't?
[3740]   Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
[3741]   Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
[3742]   Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
[3743]   Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
[3744]   Laer. Ay my lord,
[3745]   Laer. Come, my lord.                                They play.
[3746]   Laer. Come, one for me.
[3747]   Laer. Do you see this, O God?
[3748]   Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
[3749]   Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
[3750]   Laer. Farewell.                                          Exit.
[3751]   Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
[3752]   Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
[3753]   Laer. Have at you now!
[3754]   Laer. He is justly serv'd.
[3755]   Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
[3756]   Laer. How now? What noise is that?
[3757]   Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
[3758]   Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
[3759]   Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
[3760]   Laer. I pray you give me leave.
[3761]   Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      [Exeunt his Followers.]
[3762]   Laer. I will do't!
[3763]   Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
[3764]   Laer. It well appears. But tell me
[3765]   Laer. Know you the hand?
[3766]   Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
[3767]   Laer. Let this be so.
[3768]   Laer. Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
[3769]   Laer. Must there no more be done?
[3770]   Laer. My dread lord,
[3771]   Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
[3772]   Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
[3773]   Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
[3774]   Laer. My will, not all the world!
[3775]   Laer. No.
[3776]   Laer. None but his enemies.
[3777]   Laer. O, fear me not!
[3778]   Laer. O, treble woe
[3779]   Laer. Say you so? Come on.                               Play.
[3780]   Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
[3781]   Laer. The devil take thy soul!
[3782]   Laer. Think it no more.
[3783]   Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
[3784]   Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
[3785]   Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
[3786]   Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
[3787]   Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
[3788]   Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
[3789]   Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
[3790]   Laer. Well, again!
[3791]   Laer. What ceremony else?
[3792]   Laer. What ceremony else?
[3793]   Laer. What out of this, my lord?
[3794]   Laer. What part is that, my lord?
[3795]   Laer. Where is my father?
[3796]   Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
[3797]   Laer. Why ask you this?
[3798]   Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
[3799]   Laer. You mock me, sir.
[3800]   Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
[3801]   Laertes, son to Polonius.
[3802]   Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who
[3803]   Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
[3804]   Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
[3805]   Lords, ladies, Officers, Soldiers, Sailors, Messengers, Attendants.
[3806]   Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
[3807]   Mar. 'Tis gone!
[3808]   Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
[3809]   Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
[3810]   Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
[3811]   Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
[3812]   Mar. How is't, my noble lord?
[3813]   Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
[3814]   Mar. Is it not like the King?
[3815]   Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
[3816]   Mar. It is offended.
[3817]   Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
[3818]   Mar. Look with what courteous action
[3819]   Mar. Lord Hamlet!
[3820]   Mar. My good lord!
[3821]   Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
[3822]   Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
[3823]   Mar. No, it is struck.
[3824]   Mar. Nor I, my lord- in faith.
[3825]   Mar. Nor I, my lord.
[3826]   Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
[3827]   Mar. O, wonderful!
[3828]   Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
[3829]   Mar. Question it, Horatio.
[3830]   Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
[3831]   Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
[3832]   Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
[3833]   Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
[3834]   Mar. We have sworn, my lord, already.
[3835]   Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
[3836]   Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
[3837]   Marcellus, Officer.
[3838]   Marcellus, officer.
[3839]   Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
[3840]   Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
[3841]   Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
[3842]   Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.
[3843]   Oph. 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
[3844]   Oph. (Sings)
[3845]   Oph. (sings)
[3846]   Oph. (sings)
[3847]   Oph. (sings)
[3848]   Oph. And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
[3849]   Oph. At home, my lord.
[3850]   Oph. Ay, my lord.
[3851]   Oph. Ay, my lord.
[3852]   Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
[3853]   Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
[3854]   Oph. Do you doubt that?
[3855]   Oph. Good my lord,
[3856]   Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
[3857]   Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
[3858]   Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
[3859]   Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
[3860]   Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
[3861]   Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
[3862]   Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
[3863]   Oph. I was the more deceived.
[3864]   Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!
[3865]   Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
[3866]   Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
[3867]   Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
[3868]   Oph. My lord, I do not know,
[3869]   Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
[3870]   Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
[3871]   Oph. My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
[3872]   Oph. My lord?
[3873]   Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
[3874]   Oph. No more but so?
[3875]   Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
[3876]   Oph. No, my lord.
[3877]   Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
[3878]   Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
[3879]   Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
[3880]   Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
[3881]   Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you what
[3882]   Oph. Pray you mark.
[3883]   Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.
[3884]   Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.  
[3885]   Oph. Still better, and worse.
[3886]   Oph. The King rises.
[3887]   Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you,
[3888]   Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
[3889]   Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter.  
[3890]   Oph. What is, my lord?
[3891]   Oph. What means this, my lord?
[3892]   Oph. What means your lordship?
[3893]   Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
[3894]   Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
[3895]   Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
[3896]   Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
[3897]   Oph. You are merry, my lord.
[3898]   Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.
[3899]   Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O,
[3900]   Ophelia, daughter to Polonius.
[3901]   Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
[3902]   Osr. Ay, my good lord.
[3903]   Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I cannot
[3904]   Osr. How is't, Laertes?
[3905]   Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
[3906]   Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
[3907]   Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
[3908]   Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him
[3909]   Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
[3910]   Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
[3911]   Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
[3912]   Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is
[3913]   Osr. Nothing neither way.
[3914]   Osr. Of Laertes?
[3915]   Osr. Rapier and dagger.
[3916]   Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
[3917]   Osr. Sir?
[3918]   Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart
[3919]   Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
[3920]   Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
[3921]   Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
[3922]   Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
[3923]   Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
[3924]   Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
[3925]   Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
[3926]   Osric, courtier.
[3927]   Other. But is this law?
[3928]   Other. Go to!
[3929]   Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
[3930]   Other. Marry, now I can tell!
[3931]   Other. Mass, I cannot tell.
[3932]   Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
[3933]   Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand  
[3934]   Other. Was he a gentleman?
[3935]   Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
[3936]   Other. Why, 'tis found so.
[3937]   Other. Why, he had none.
[3938]   Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
[3939]   Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
[3940]   Player. I warrant your honour.
[3941]   Players.
[3942]   Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
[3943]   Pol. 'Tis most true;
[3944]   Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
[3945]   Pol. And let him ply his music.
[3946]   Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
[3947]   Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?
[3948]   Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
[3949]   Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
[3950]   Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
[3951]   Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
[3952]   Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
[3953]   Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
[3954]   Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
[3955]   Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
[3956]   Pol. Come, sirs.
[3957]   Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
[3958]   Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
[3959]   Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
[3960]   Pol. Farewell!
[3961]   Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
[3962]   Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
[3963]   Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
[3964]   Pol. Give o'er the play.
[3965]   Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
[3966]   Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     [Reads.]  
[3967]   Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
[3968]   Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
[3969]   Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
[3970]   Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
[3971]   Pol. Honest, my lord?
[3972]   Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol; Brutus
[3973]   Pol. I have, my lord.
[3974]   Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
[3975]   Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
[3976]   Pol. I will say so.                                      Exit.
[3977]   Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,  
[3978]   Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
[3979]   Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant sometimes
[3980]   Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
[3981]   Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
[3982]   Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's
[3983]   Pol. Mad for thy love?  
[3984]   Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
[3985]   Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
[3986]   Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
[3987]   Pol. Marry, well bethought!
[3988]   Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
[3989]   Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
[3990]   Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
[3991]   Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
[3992]   Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
[3993]   Pol. Not I, my lord.
[3994]   Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.  
[3995]   Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
[3996]   Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
[3997]   Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
[3998]   Pol. That hath made him mad.
[3999]   Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
[4000]   Pol. That's very true, my lord.
[4001]   Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
[4002]   Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
[4003]   Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
[4004]   Pol. This business is well ended.
[4005]   Pol. This is too long.
[4006]   Pol. Upon my honour-
[4007]   Pol. Very like a whale.
[4008]   Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
[4009]   Pol. What do you think of me?
[4010]   Pol. What follows then, my lord?
[4011]   Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
[4012]   Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
[4013]   Pol. What said he?
[4014]   Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
[4015]   Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
[4016]   Pol. With what, i' th' name of God I
[4017]   Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
[4018]   Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
[4019]   Pol. You know sometimes he walks four hours together
[4020]   Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
[4021]   Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter. Yet
[4022]   Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
[4023]   Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.-
[4024]   Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
[4025]   Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
[4026]   Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if this
[4027]   Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
[4028]   Polonius, Lord Chamberlain.
[4029]   Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
[4030]   Priest. No more be done.
[4031]   Queen. Alack,
[4032]   Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
[4033]   Queen. Alas, he's mad!
[4034]   Queen. Alas, how is't with you,  
[4035]   Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
[4036]   Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
[4037]   Queen. As kill a king?
[4038]   Queen. Ay me, what act,
[4039]   Queen. Ay, amen!
[4040]   Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
[4041]   Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
[4042]   Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
[4043]   Queen. But not by him!
[4044]   Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
[4045]   Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
[4046]   Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
[4047]   Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
[4048]   Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
[4049]   Queen. Did he receive you well?
[4050]   Queen. Did you assay him  
[4051]   Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
[4052]   Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
[4053]   Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
[4054]   Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
[4055]   Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
[4056]   Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
[4057]   Queen. Have you forgot me?
[4058]   Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
[4059]   Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!  
[4060]   Queen. How fares my lord?
[4061]   Queen. How now, Ophelia?
[4062]   Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
[4063]   Queen. I shall obey you;
[4064]   Queen. I will not speak with her.
[4065]   Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.          Drinks.
[4066]   Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him coming.
[4067]   Queen. If it be,
[4068]   Queen. Let her come in.  
[4069]   Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
[4070]   Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
[4071]   Queen. More matter, with less art.
[4072]   Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
[4073]   Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
[4074]   Queen. No more!
[4075]   Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
[4076]   Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
[4077]   Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
[4078]   Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
[4079]   Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
[4080]   Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
[4081]   Queen. O my son, what theme?  
[4082]   Queen. O, speak to me no more!
[4083]   Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
[4084]   Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
[4085]   Queen. So he does indeed.
[4086]   Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
[4087]   Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.  
[4088]   Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
[4089]   Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
[4090]   Queen. This is mere madness;
[4091]   Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
[4092]   Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
[4093]   Queen. To whom do you speak this?
[4094]   Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
[4095]   Queen. What shall I do?
[4096]   Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
[4097]   Queen. What would she have?
[4098]   Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?  
[4099]   Queen. it may be, very like.
[4100]   Rey. As gaming, my lord.
[4101]   Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and  
[4102]   Rey. Ay, my lord,
[4103]   Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.  
[4104]   Rey. But, my good lord-
[4105]   Rey. Good my lord!                                    [Going.]
[4106]   Rey. I shall, my lord.
[4107]   Rey. I will, my lord.
[4108]   Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
[4109]   Rey. My lord, I have.
[4110]   Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
[4111]   Rey. Very good, my lord.
[4112]   Rey. Well, my lord.
[4113]   Reynaldo, servant to Polonius.
[4114]   Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
[4115]   Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
[4116]   Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
[4117]   Ros. Believe what?
[4118]   Ros. Both your Majesties
[4119]   Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
[4120]   Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
[4121]   Ros. Good my lord!
[4122]   Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely
[4123]   Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
[4124]   Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
[4125]   Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.
[4126]   Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself
[4127]   Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
[4128]   Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
[4129]   Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
[4130]   Ros. Most like a gentleman.
[4131]   Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.  
[4132]   Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
[4133]   Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
[4134]   Ros. My most dear lord!
[4135]   Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,
[4136]   Ros. Neither, my lord.
[4137]   Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
[4138]   Ros. No indeed are they not.  
[4139]   Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
[4140]   Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
[4141]   Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
[4142]   Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
[4143]   Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
[4144]   Ros. Then is the world one.
[4145]   Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
[4146]   Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
[4147]   Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
[4148]   Ros. To what end, my lord?
[4149]   Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
[4150]   Ros. We shall, my lord.
[4151]   Ros. We think not so, my lord.
[4152]   Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
[4153]   Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
[4154]   Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for your
[4155]   Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
[4156]   Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
[4157]   Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
[4158]   Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
[4159]   Rosencrantz, courtier.
[4160]   Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you,
[4161]   Sailor. God bless you, sir.
[4162]   Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for you.
[4163]   Two Clowns, gravediggers.
[4164]   Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
